# Week 4 overview

This week, you will create the *final version* of your project. Every single feature should work like it was meant to be! Not much time left now, so squash that bug soon!

Don't forget to take a look (now) at the way your project will be assessed and graded. It's in the syllabus! We'll be here to help you make your final steps :-)

Last but not least, we'll finish the project with presentations and demos, and we'll take the time to say final goodbyes as you go out into the world and create more software!
