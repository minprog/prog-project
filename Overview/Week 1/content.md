# Week 1 overview

This week, you will create a *prototype* of your applications's user interface. It will probably
change extensively in the following weeks, but doing this now should provide a good starting point
for further development. By creating a prototype this early, you can focus on more fundamental
problems in later weeks.

Before jumping into your code editor, you must first create a proposal document and a design document. These documents function as a (partial) contract between you and the staff. They describe what you will make and how you will make it. Staff can use these documents to judge the complexity and feasibility of your plans.

Note that what you *think* you'll make may not entirely be what your final product actually looks like! It may prove hard to include some functionality, which might need to be scrapped. No worries! The final requirement of this project is that you create a completely functional product that makes sense as a whole and is of sufficient complexity. The details may change over the next few week. Just make sure to discuss changed with your mentor!
