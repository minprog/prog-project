# Week 2 overview

This week, you will create a *alpha version* of your project. This means that some essential parts are now functioning well, while other parts may not be implemented yet. And bugs will be everywhere! But that's fine.

An alpha version is a proof-of-concept of sorts: it shows that your project is feasible and developing it provides you with feedback on what works and what doesn't. You'll probably try a few things that don't work and at the end of the week your ideas will have converged to a clear vision of what the final product is going to look like, even though your alpha version may not quite look like it.

While working on this part of your project it is most essential to update your process book each day. You will make very important decisions of what you're going to keep and what will not work out. These decisions need to be documented for inclusion in your final report. So update that process book!
