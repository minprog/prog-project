# Week 3 overview

This week, you will create a *beta version* of your project. This means that your project is "feature-complete", and every single piece of functionality that you're going to provide to your user is there, albeit somewhat buggy still.

Your development this week provides you with input for decisions that you make at the end of the week: what will you keep and what will need to go? Some of the features that you thought were so important now have to be scrapped, as they simply didn't work out as expected. That's great! Better to have a small set of features that feels coherent and provides for an interesting final product, than having some half-baked features lying around that confuse whoever is using it. Don't look back!

Towards the end of the week you should probably be doing a small informal code review with another student. Your code may be confusing still and need a little bit of restructuring. There's still time!
