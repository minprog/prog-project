# Team meetings

Each week, you will provide a progress update to your team. These are pretty formal meetings, with the goal of getting a fresh eye on your work once a week. Teams will be assigned randomly.

## Teams

Your team name is displayed at the top-left of this website. For example, you may be in team **Data (Winter) A**. It's your task to find the other team members!

## Choosing a time

The first week on Tuesday at 13:00 is the first meeting opportunity. Everyone should be there to meet their teams. If you can't find a team member (even if just 1!), report to room A1.20 where lost+found team members are tracked :-)

## Reporting

After every standup, you must provide a brief report on what has been discussed. It is fine if one of you types the report. Just send an e-mail to help@mprog.nl mentioning your team name. **Please do not** send word documents or other attachments, just plain text in an e-mail is best!

## Topics

### Week 1

Show your technical design and explain what you still have to research to get your app working - other team members share their ideas on your problems. Take ample time to do this and be nice to your team members!

### Week 2

Show your progress from last week. Then, take an hour or so to create a basic style guide with your team! Find style guides on the internet, specifically for your platform (google "d3 style guide", "javascript style guide"), and then write your own guide based on the ideas from those guides. Then put in your style guide:

- 10 (or so) basic rules that any code in your repository should follow
- a couple of links to style guides on the web, for each explaining what part of those guides your code will adhere to

Add the style guide to your own repo as `STYLE.md`. Everyone is allowed to choose their own style rules, as long as they are reasonably in line with what "professionals" do.

### Week 3

Show and discuss your progress from last week. This week, you'll finish most of your project, so it's also time to scrap some of your plans! Discuss and write down a plan.

Also, show your repository to your team members. Let them navigate through it and note any questions they have. Also let them browse your code and do a code review. More info on this later.

## Week 4

Everyone provides an update and makes a decision of what to submit and what to delete (if needed). Others help! Make a plan for your video and discuss with the others. Walk them through the video and note if they don't understand something. Use this to make the video better!

Also, do a final check on each others' repositories.
