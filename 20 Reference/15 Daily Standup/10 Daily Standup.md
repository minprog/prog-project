# Daily Standup

Each day, you will provide a progress update to your team. Such a meeting will often be fairly brief, but it has an important objective: making sure that every member of your team knows what you will be working on and vice-versa. This way, you can later discuss problems that you encounter, especially if you plan on doing the same kind of development that day!

Standups are a practice that supports "agile" software development in teams. Generally speaking, this means iteratively developing an understanding of the problem being solved (e.g., what kind of system will really help this company?), while creating more and more refined solutions for that problem. In such a process, daily standup are an important factor in team communication. It is a time to summarize what has been done and to theorize what needs to be done, all so that teammates can help each other better understand the problem at hand.

(Usually, agile methods are being used when teams work on the same problem. You, however, will be working on your own projects. The idea remains the same: articulating your plans and getting feedback.)

## Every day

Be sure to hold this meeting every day at 10 o'clock! We want everyone to be aware of their team's work. Watch this video for a short overview of good standup meetings.

Your meetings will definitely take longer than 15 minutes, because we're also giving you some extra assignments to do during the meetings.

## Reporting back

You should write a note in your process book, specifically about what you have learned during the daily standup. If you can't think of anything to write, best to ask more feedback about your ideas during the standups!

## Week 1

In Week 1, use the following themes during your standup meetings:

- Day 2: meetup and introduce your projects - for each project, ask each other the question: "What kind of person will use this project? What will they learn, or how will their lives be made easier/happier?" Make notes about what others think and your reflections on this.
- Day 3: present your technical design and explain what you still have to research to get your app working - other team members share their ideas
- Day 4: present a clear to do list about what you will need to research in the coming weeks to make your app work - others help to make the list as complete as possible
- Day 5: show your prototype, which supports navigation and has basic texts and buttons, maybe a non-functional graph - others try to make sense of it, give feedback on how useful/clear/navigable it seems

Always make notes in your process book! You will be graded on this process book :-)

## Week 2

- Day 1: present your plans for the week, what is realistic to achieve by Friday?
- Day 2: show your progress from Monday, amend your plans, discuss
- Day 3: take an hour or so to create a basic style guide with your team! - the [style guide](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/10/why-coding-style-matters/) should be a reflection of personal choices about how your code looks, and it should also refer to the official style guides from iOS/Android/D3 and specify which parts to apply in your project and which should not apply - use this session to find sample style guides together, gather some links and think what rules to put in
- Day 4: present your personal style guide (in STYLE.md in your repository) - discuss the differences with others' style guides
- Day 5: show your alpha version which should have working parts (e.g. showing data, loading/saving settings, good navigation, useful texts) - others provide feedback

## Week 3 ##

- Day 1: present your plans for the week, what is realistic to achieve by Friday?
- Day 2: show your progress from Monday, amend your plans, discuss
- Day 3: everyone shows the team their repo and gets open feedback; the goal is to find out if the repo structure and class structure are easy to understand
- Day 4: everyone tells about their progress and the others help make a realistic plan for finalizing functionality or cutting features
- Day 5: show your beta version which should be completely functional (e.g. every graph and interaction works, data can be entered and retrieved, etc) - others provide feedback on the usefulness

## Week 4

- Day 1: present your plans for the week, what is realistic to achieve by Friday?
- Day 2: everyone provides an update and makes a decision of what to submit and what to delete (if needed). others help!
- Day 3: show your final product and ideas for recording the product video - others give feedback on what's good to show and what not
- Day 4: everyone shows their repository and others do a final check for problems
- Day 5: no standup, final demos
