# Process book

An important part of your project is your process book. Your process book details your steps in developing your solution, including the alternative designs you tried, and the insights you got. 

## Goal

Equally important to your final results is how you got there! Your process book is the place you describe and document the space of possibilities you explored at each step of your project. It is not, however, a journal or lab notebook that describes every single detail --- you should think carefully about the important decisions you made and insights you gained and present your reasoning in a concise way. You are preserving the knowledge that you are gaining during the process for later reference. 

## What to include

We ask you to include many figures in your process book, including photos of your sketches of potential designs, screen shots from different visualization tools you explored, inspirations of visualizations you found online, etc. Several images illustrating changes in your design or focus over time will be far more informative than text describing those changes. Instead, use text to describe the rationale behind the evolution of your project.

## Starting out

Create a file called **PROCESS.md** in the root of your repository. Organize your notes by day, by including headings:

    # Day 2
