# Programmeerproject<br><small>Studiewijzer</small>

*Summer 2019*

This project is the final course of the programming minor, and for the first time, you'll be able to create your very own piece of software from scratch. With this experience, we hope to enable you to independently study computer science or go out in the world and start creating your own software.

## Expectations

In this course, you will create a single software project, based on the platform knowledge you acquired in previous courses: iOS, Android, D3.js or Django. Your task is to deliver a fully functional and useful product at the end of the course. See [project requirements](/reference/requirements) for further details.

> Note: the project cannot be done 1) on the basis of an existing codebase, 2) under external supervision and/or 3) in exchange for any compensation by third parties, at any time. It might, however, be possible to do such a project outside of the usual offerings of this course. Contact the course's instructor to discuss.


## Schedule

Your application will be developed taking into account the following milestones:

| Week 1                        | Deadline             |

| Exhibition                    | Friday, 11:00--15:00 |  


## Activities

**Project** --- As expected in a project course, you will spend most of your day designing and coding your product. In the afternoons, help will be available from the course's staff, who consult on design decisions and provide feedback on ideas or code.

**Stand-up** --- From day 2, you will kick off every day with a stand-up meeting, discussing progress with about four teammates. Every group member highlights the work of the previous day, plans for today, and potential problems ahead. Stand-ups may incidentally be visited by instructors.

**Process book** --- Together with your completed software project, you will hand in a process book that documents the development process. It contains your daily resume of design decisions and other considerations. You need to update this document every day and push to GitHub.

**Product video** --- Toward the end of the project, you'll make a product demo video, demonstrating all important interactions that a typical user may have with it. The video will be used for assessing the final state of your project.

**Exhibition** --- The final part of this course is the exhibition, where you are expected to demo your finished project to other students, family, friends and the teaching staff.


## Attendance

You are required to attend every project day (20 days) between 9:30 and 16:30. You are allowed to miss 10% of this time during the course, but you must in any case attend:

- the first Monday
- the final Friday

Your attendance will be noted as you "ask" a question through the website and subsequently discuss your design or a problem with a member of staff. Make sure you ask at least one question each day!

In cases of emergency, inform the instructor **immediately** via e-mail to make arrangements on finishing the course. In many cases, this will entail finishing the course in a later semester.


## Feedback

Some types of feedback are pre-arranged in this course:

- you'll be assigned a mentor, who will discuss your project with you and one fellow student, once a week
- in the first days, you should receive approval (via this website) for your project proposal and design document; this approval is required to continue the course
- the daily standups include many different activities that allow you to receive feedback from your fellow students
- you may get a few "issues" entered for your GitHub project by the staff, usually regarding problems with your repository; make sure to resolve these issues immediately

It is your own responsibility in this course to make sure you get the feedback you need. In particular, make sure that you get some feedback on your documents long before the approval deadline! In cases of conflicting feedback, always ask your instructor for a definitive answer. If you can't find your instructor, [send an e-mail](mailto:help@mprog.nl).


## Assessment

During the project, you will use a single public GitHub repository to keep your "work product" and work towards the final version of your project. The repository will ultimately contain your product, final report, process book, and any materials needed to assess your project results. Your grade for this course will be determined on the basis of five criteria of equal weight:

*Solution* --- To what extent does your project implement the features as agreed upon, and is it useful for your intended audience? The final solution will be graded primarily on usefulness and coherence.

*Interaction design* --- To what extent is your project consistent with good practices as described by the platform vendor as well as what you've learned elsewhere in the course? Grading will be done on things like consistent design, obvious navigation, ease of use and prevention of errors.

*Process* --- To what extent have you followed a rigorous design and development process and have you worked with others to enhance your and their learning? The process will be graded on evaluation of rigor as evidenced in your process book, your daily commits and your documentation of code reviews.

*Final report* --- To what extent have you clearly documented your project, the design, and your understanding of the chosen topic? The final report will be graded on axes of clarity and thoroughness. The main goal of the report is to provide a clear overview of your project and its code.

*Code* --- To what extent is your code well-designed and readable? The code quality will be graded  on the tidyness and conformity of your repository and using a code quality rubric that you can retrieve on this website.

On each of these criteria, you will receive a grade 1--5:

1. Poor
2. Fair: ample room for improvement
3. Good: some room for improvement
4. Very good: minor room for improvement
5. Excellent: essentially no room for improvement

Scoring 1 on any of the criteria, or failing to meet expectations as mentioned earlier, will generally result in a failing grade for the course.


## Deadlines and late submissions

Extensions on the project proposal, design documentation and repository set-up are not granted, except in cases of emergency. Extensions need to be confirmed via e-mail by the courses' heads. Technical difficulties do not constitute emergencies.

Projects submitted *n* hours late may be penalized by 10% for *n* in (0, 24], by 25% for *n* in (24, 48], by 50% for *n* in (48, 72], and by 100% for *n* greater than 72. Lateness will be determined by submissions' timestamps.


## Attribution

While you must make a substantial original contribution during this course, you are expected to share ideas and knowledge liberally with your fellow students, to make good use of forums, blog posts and other web pages to obtain knowledge needed to implement your application, while citing in a section of your project's README, and in comments, any sources you use, especially if it concerns borrowing code.
