# Design Document

Based on your proposal, you can now start studying your problem in a more
technical fashion. During this phase of defining your application, the teaching
staff and your fellow students can spot if there are fundamental
problems that need to be solved, or if there technical limitations that will
prevent you from finishing the application.

First of all, be sure to make clear which parts of the application define the *minimum viable product* and which parts may be optional to implement.

Use the decomposition you made earlier to map parts of the solution on the
framework(s) that you are using. Think about and fully express how the user
interface will be handled, where the data is coming from, and how the various
parts will work together to form a complete application. Remember, it is
expected that you separate the user interface from the data provider whenever
possible.

Some parts that you may describe here:

- a list of classes and public methods (and their return types and/or
  arguments) that you’ve decided to implement

- advanced sketches of UIs that clearly explain which features are connected to
  which underlying classes

- a list of APIs and frameworks that you will be using to provide functionality
  in your app

- a list of data sources, and database tables and fields (and their types) that
  you’ve decided to implement

If your application has multiple independent programs working together (e.g. to
clean your dataset) you need to provide a high-level overview of these
components and then provide a lowel-level overview of the inner workings of
each component.
