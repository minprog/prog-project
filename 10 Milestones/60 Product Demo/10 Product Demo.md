# Product demo

To make sure that the course's staff doesn't miss any interesting feature of your product when grading, you will make a screencast demonstrating your product's features in **maximum 3 minutes**. A screencast is simply a recording of your computer or mobile screen, combined with audio of your voice, explaining how the product works.

Keep in mind: the video does not have to be *perfect*! Most important is that the features of your product are clearly demonstrated.

## Script

Before recording, make a script of what you would like to show. Keep in mind the following requirements:

* Start with an introduction of the goals of your project: who will use it, in what situation and what will they get out of it.

* Show how a user would go about using the product. Show the most common way of going through the application.

* Then, show other ways of navigating the application, special features, exceptions.

* Always show all features: anything that's not in the video does not exist.

Your demo may be narrated in either Dutch or English. Make sure your demonstration does not take longer than 3 minutes. PowerPoint or other tools are not allowed, just show the product. Here are two examples: a [data visualisation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=13&v=zvaAuhy_0_Q) and a [mobile app](https://youtu.be/oBUHaiU5GAo).

## Tip

If your application supports something like logins, entering the login info may take a bit too long. Consider hard-coding some username and password on the login screen, so you can simply press a button to login.

## Recording

You can use any tool you'd like if you already know how to record screen casts. Don't overdo it, but do make sure your voice is audible and only the relevant parts of the screen are recorded.

### Mac

* Open Quicktime Player.

* Choose File > New Screen Recording.

* Using the dropdown arrow next to the "record" button, make sure the correct microphone is selected. Leave the "Show Mouse Clicks" option selected.

* Press "record". You can then drag to select the relevant part of your screen.

* To stop recording, use the menu bar in the upper-right corner of your screen. After this, you can use Quicktime's editing tools to cut out some parts of your recording.

### Windows

* Download Google Chrome if you do not have it already.

* Click on the icon with the three vertical dots in the right upper corner. Then choose More tools > Extensions > Get more extensions.

* Using the search bar find "Screen Castify" > Add to Chrome.

* Click on the Screen Castify icon, then choose Start recording desktop > Share. From now on everything on your screen will be recorded.

* To end the recording, click the Screen Castify logo and choose Stop.

### Android

Several screen recorder applications are available for your mobile phone through the Play Store. We have tested "DU recorder", which works fine.

### iOS

If you have iOS 11, a screen recorder is included with the system. You can access it from the control center, but you will have to enable it in the Settings app. [See how.](https://9to5mac.com/2017/06/08/how-to-enable-screen-recording-ios-11-without-a-computer/)

If you don't have iOS 11, you can easily record a screencast using Quicktime Player on your Mac. Connect your phone to your computer using a cable, create a New Movie Recording in Quicktime. In the dropdown menu next to the "record" button, choose your phone as the video source.

## Uploading

After recording your video, upload it to Youtube or another video streaming service.  Include a link to your video in the `README.md` on GitHub.
