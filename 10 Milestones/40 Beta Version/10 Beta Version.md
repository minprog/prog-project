# Minimum viable product (deadline: Friday)

This week, you'll work towards presenting the beta of your project. Make sure that you have a fully *working* product, even though it need not be finished in terms of small bugs and code quality. You cannot add new functionality after this deadline!

## Submitting

You will need to submit your beta code by *push*ing it to GitHub, as usual.
