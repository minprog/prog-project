# Prototype version

You will now create a prototype of your applications's user interface. It will
probably change extensively in the following weeks, but doing this now should
provide a good starting point for further development. By creating a prototype
this early, you can focus on more fundamental problems in later weeks.


## Requirements

- All screens must be there, some introductory text or graphics, buttons etc, and navigation is working.

- If you need data from an external source, you **must** have a working script to import the data
  from a file or a working connection to the live data source. (Any data preprocessing scripts
  should be contained in an entirely separate folder in your repository, called `scripts`.)

- The proposal and design document must be included as described elsewhere.

Your repository will be checked for completeness and you may not proceed if one of these elements is still missing.


## Repository

Commit and push all new code to GitHub. Don't forget to update your **README.md** if you have made any incompatible decisions, and push that file, too!
